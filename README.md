## About This App

After reading a research paper, we implemented the core algorithm in Python based on the MATLAB code provided in the study. The app includes:

- **30 test functions**, including **9 essential ones** required for experiments, to thoroughly test the algorithm.
- The ability for users to input their own test functions for **algorithm optimization testing**, greatly enhancing flexibility.
- Implementation of **5 comparison algorithms** to highlight the advantages of the **BWO algorithm**.

## Experiment Settings

On this webpage, you can:

- Modify **dimensions** and **iteration counts** to customize your optimization experiments.
- Choose from the implemented **optimization algorithms** and **test functions** to explore different scenarios.
- After executing the optimization, view:
  - A **table of results** summarizing the algorithm's performance.
  - A **curve** showing the progress of iterations.
